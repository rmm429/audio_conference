- userInfo: dictionary containing Amazon ID as key and intent info JSON as value
	- key: Amazon user ID taken from event.context.System.user.userID
	- value: intent info JSON
		- startIntent: ensures that we came from the intent StartIntent
		- PN: the phone number that was provided to start the conference
		- BeAnywhere: the Be Anywhere deivce that was provided to start the conference

• userInfo is a global dictionary
• First, the userInfo dictionary is evaluated to see if an info JSON already exists for the current Amazon user
	• If the info JSON does not exist, it is created before any intents and/or requests are invoked
		• startIntent = false
		• PN = ""
		• BeAnywhere = ""
• When the intent StartIntent is invoked:
	• The boolean startIntent will be set to true
	• The phone number or Be Anywhere deivce name will be saved in its appropriate string
		• If one string is not empty, then the other string will be empty (always true)
			• e.g. if a phone number is provided, then a Be Anywhere device was not provided
• If the intent StopIntent is invoked without the intent StartIntent having been invoked beforehand, the boolean startIntent in the info JSON will be false
	• Since the intent StartIntent was never invoked, the value of the boolean startIntent was never set to true
	• If the boolean startIntent is false, the main funcitonality of the intent StartIntent will not be executed (error handled, message through Alexa)
• When the intent StopIntent is completed, the variables in info JSON are set to the default values
	• startIntent = false
	• PN = ""
	• BeAnywhere = ""
• Careful checking: within each intent, a check is done to see if the info JSON exists for the current Amazon user before executing the main functionality
	• Even though the info JSON is created before any intents and/or requests are invoked if it does not already exist for the current Amazon user
